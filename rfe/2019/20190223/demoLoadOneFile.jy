# Bob and I were wondering why Autoplot can't get a file if it can't list it.  I need to
# review this.

from org.das2.util.filesystem import FileSystem
FileSystem.reset()

# In this step, Das2 attempts to connect to the root, so that authentication can be done.
fs= FileSystem.create('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/autoplot/scripts/master/')

fo= fs.getFileObject('makeTutorialHtml.jy')
f= fo.getFile(monitor)

print 'length=', f.length()
