# Bob and I were wondering why Autoplot can't get a file if it can't list it.  I need to
# review this.

from org.das2.util.filesystem import FileSystem
fs= FileSystem.create('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/autoplot/scripts/master/')
fo= fs.getFileObject('makeTutorialHtml.jy')
f= fo.getFile(monitor)
