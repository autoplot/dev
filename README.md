Development area containing scripts demoing bugs and features

The area "bugs" contains directories numbered by the SourceForge bug number, containing scripts 
demonstrating bugs or useful for debugging.  For example the folder "2110" is for a bug described by 
https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2110/.

The area "rfe" contains directories with rfe numbers, where 664 is described by 
https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/feature-requests/664/.  

Both directories may contain 8-digit dates for $Y$m$d for quick demonstrations of bugs that are immediately 
fixed and never described in SourceForge.

Note scripts can be run directly in Autoplot directly (that's new, see 2019a branch) using https://github.com/autoplot/dev/blob/master/bugs/20190212/demoWhereNot.jy or https://github.com/autoplot/dev/bugs/20190212/demoWhereNot.jy

Here's a test of including LaTeX in documents:
