This demonstrates the logic where the first datum assigned to a dimensionless dataset will set the units for the dataset.  
This might be useful logic, but one should be aware of this, and there are some pitfalls when a bundle dataset is created.  
(A bundle dataset is when the columns of a dataset each have different names and units, as with an events dataset.)
