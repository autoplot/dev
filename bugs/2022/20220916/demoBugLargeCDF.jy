# Kristoff reported a bug where writing large CDF files fails.  My understanding
# is that the file cannot be greater than 2GB.  When reading a CDF file, no
# variable within the CDF can be more than 2GB, but the entire file may be.  The
# goal is writing CDF files should have the same constraints.
