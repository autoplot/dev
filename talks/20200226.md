I need a place to put notes for the upcoming talk on Autoplot scripting at Iowa.

# What is a Script 
* "Compact" store of business function
  * One file, one action, for example "Digitize Juno Data" or "Show Voyager Low-Rate".
  * Can easily be moved and interpretted out-of-context.  (Attached to an email)
  * This is not strictly required, one can import libraries but in a "web-enabled" way using getFile and eval
* easily-generated controls
  * getParam function used instead of method with parameters.
  * one line per parameter
  * default value is encouraged, to help with discovery.
  * one-line label is encouraged.
  * constraints on values, enumerations, and examples
* easy-generated interface
  * setScriptTitle is a one-line title
  * setScriptDescription allows a paragraph-length description
* Note this means I can do create other interfaces
  * unix% autoplot --script=myscript.jy scriptArgA=1 scriptArgB=3
  * https://jfaden.net/AutoplotServlet/ScriptGUIServlet

# What can be done with a script
* Quick calculations.  Have B, want FCE,  http://emfisis.physics.uiowa.edu/pub/jyds/fce_A_4sec_L3.jyds
* Data operations.  Show one variable only when another is big,  http://emfisis.physics.uiowa.edu/pub/jyds/filterParm.jyds
* Custom plots, https://abbith.physics.uiowa.edu/jbf/juno/blob/master/u/masafumi/2020/20200225/JunoWigglePlotForSadie.jy
* Science Workflows, https://abbith.physics.uiowa.edu/jbf/juno/blob/master/u/doug/2020/20200221/upDownDigitizer.jy

# SVN 
* SVN allows teams to work on a common code base, merging their work together.
* SVN was used for years (and still is) for managing scripts.  
* We would make changes in a "local working copy" and then commit them to the server.
* The scientists would then run scripts from a web site.

# GitHub
* Git is like SVN, but is newer and maybe more flexible (and complex).  Like Object Oriented Programming, it's hard for people used to SVN but not so hard for new people.
* There's a clear "center" where everything is stored.
* GitHub is site set up years ago and is now owned by Microsoft.
* It is a Git, but it also adds a web interface to the files, and you can edit files right on the site.
* Since GitHub is set up already and freely available, it's great place for anyone to start using.
* Autoplot can interface with GitHub as well, knowing the tricks to get raw files.

# GitLabs
* GitHub is just one instance of GitLabs, which is free software. 
* Any workgroup can set up a GitLabs instance, like:
  * http://abbith.physics.uiowa.edu,  Radio and Plasma Waves Group instance.
  * http://git.uiowa.edu, University of Iowa instance.
  * http://jfaden.net/git, My instance at home.
* Autoplot needs to recognize a GitLabs instance, and this is presently hard-coded.  TO-BE-DONE
* All projects Autoplot can use must be public.  Another TO-BE-DONE is to allow private projects.

# Other nice features of GitLabs
* Markdown is built in.  Any ".md" file is displayed using a MarkDown renderer.
  * Headings, Lists, Paragraphs 
  * Tables
  * Images
  * LaTeX
* Markdown should be sufficient for writing nice documentation and making notes.
* Also markdown is intended to look descent when the raw HTML is displayed.  In 50 years, documentation still "works."
* Built-in search engine
* History -- you can get to and run old script versions.
* Issue tracking
* readme.md is automatically displayed.

# Questions for GitLabs Management
* I've been using GitLabs for writing scripts for people for about 6 months, I'd like to get this "right."
* Duplicate copies of scripts.
* I'll write an ad-hoc script for some study and send a link to a scientist.
* Before long, other scientists are using it
* I'd suggest there are some scripts which should be a well-tested and reliable resource we can all use.
* How do we know when this is the case?
* The ad-hoc version could point to the new version.

# New script documentation coming
* Autoplot's scripting documentation is at http://www-pw.physics.uiowa.edu/~jbf/autoplot/javadoc2018/
* This is "JavaDoc"--automatic documentation for Java code.
* It works by convention, where documentation within the code is converted to a website with the JavaDoc tool.
* Since Autoplot's Jython is really just calling Java codes, this works for documentation.
* But--it's inefficient, and unaware that Jython is use for it, and optimizations made.
* Also, the built-in script editor can render html, but new versions of JavaDoc make HTML which don't render well.
* JavaDoc allows extention, and I've been working to make an extension to make documentation geared towards Jython use.
* http://www-pw.physics.uiowa.edu/~jbf/autoplot/doc/ will appear nicely in the popup editor, and will include links
to GitHub and the Java source code.

# Using scripts
* setScriptTitle and setScriptDescription make the GUI.
* what's happening.  Autoplot downloads the script and passes the local filename to the Jython interpretter.
  * what's really happening is Autoplot checks timestamps on files and hashes to see if new version must be downloaded.
  * Note there's some odd bug between Java's caching of GitHub which means Autoplot doesn't automatically get the file, it needs about a minute to pass before the change will propagate.
  * Our GitLabs installations don't have this problem.
* Use case: Sadie needed a particular version of Masafumi's plot.  Masafumi copies his script on to GitLabs, makes the change and then points her to the version.

# .jy vs .jyds scripts
* .jy is application-level scripts.
* .jyds can only access data stuff.

# Basic Script
~~~~~
mag= getDataSet('vap+cdf:http://emfisis.physics.uiowa.edu/Flight/RBSP-A/L3/$Y/$m/$d/rbsp-a_magnetometer_4sec-gei_emfisis-L3_$Y$m$d_v$(v,sep).cdf?timerange=2019-01-01&Magnitude')
fce= mag*28
plot( fce, ytitle='FCE' )
~~~~~

# Autoplot DOM
* the "DOM" is the application state.  Every Autoplot instance has one.
* When you say "plot" you are modifying the DOM.
