I need a place to put notes for the upcoming talk on Autoplot scripting at Iowa.

# What is a Script 
* "Compact" store of business function
  * One file, one action, for example "Digitize Juno Data" or "Show Voyager Low-Rate".
  * Can easily be moved and interpretted out-of-context.  (Attached to an email)
  * This is not strictly required, one can import libraries but in a "web-enabled" way using getFile and eval
* easily-generated controls
  * getParam function used instead of method with parameters.
  * one line per parameter
  * default value is encouraged, to help with discovery.
  * one-line label is encouraged.
  * constraints on values, enumerations, and examples
* easy-generated interface
  * setScriptTitle is a one-line title
  * setScriptDescription allows a paragraph-length description
* Note this means I can do things like create a web interface.
