= Features Everyone Should Know About =
* URIs -- locate data
* URI history (what's a URI)
* Launch methods, memory.
* reading a cdf file (demo 5)  Note file references can be remote.
* aggregation
* das2server
* cdaweb server
* HAPI servers
* running scripts
* .vap files
* file references can be remote, which makes your vap usable by others, and usable by me if there are problems I need to look at.
* scripts .jyds and .jy.  .jyds are limited and should not be able to hurt your computer.  .jy can so a review screen is shown.
* Autoplot rendering modes. nn spectrograms.  Huge scatter.
* Autoplot RTEs--what are they and where do they go?  DasServer RTEs.

= More Features =
* Events Lists
* Edit multiple nodes at once.  
* management of versions at U.Iowa and in general.  What "autoplot" at the command line means and when it is updated.
* pngwalk tool and digitizing
* scripting
  - scripting expert writes a script and sends it to you--security warnings and why
  - hacking a little script
  - alternative for IDL and Matlab--why you might do this.  Documentation is the issue.
* Testing
  - Jenkins server.  
  - What you can do to help--give me your URIs, your vaps, your scripts

= Features Coming Out of U. Iowa =
* scale property
* mashup tool
* tickValues property
* features are a bit like books in a home library.  You start with a small bookshelf, add a bunch of books.  After a while you have too many books, so you have to stop and build a new bookshelf.  It's easy to get crummy books that no one reads.  Get too many books and you need a catalog.  However, books are "discrete"--adding one book doesn't affect other books--but with software often one part affects another.
