* Autoplot is an application for easily plotting data from different sources.
* You enter in a data URI, it retrieves the data and plots it.
* URIs are a compact way to represent a data set, a one-line string that can
be pasted in an email and sent to a collegue.
* URIs have editors which provide a GUI for creating the URIs.
* Plot is interactive, where you can zoom in on the data, look at slices, etc.
* You can add additional plots and they will be connected
* scan around in time, for example, and all plots move together
* Some data sources allow for discovery.  What's out there?
* Often these sources allow you to browse in time as well, loading more data
as you scan to the next day.
