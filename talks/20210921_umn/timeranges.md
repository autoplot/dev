# Time Ranges
We collect data producing long time series of data, so time ends up being the
first thing that organizes the data in our field.  Like most software we use,
searching by time is optimized.  

The green and blue push button dots in the upper left of the GUI control whether
the focus data source is displayed, or the current time range.  Pressing on the 
blue dot will show the time range, if there is one.  The droplist will have 
recent times entered, and the calendar icon will bring up the "select time
range" GUI.  Note the folder/magnifier icon ("inspect" icon) will go show the
editor for the focus data set.
