Autoplot's layout is simple, just divide the page into some number of plots
and go from there.  However there's really a lot more to it and control that 
Autoplot (and the Das2 library used for its graphics) provides.

* plot boundaries can be tweaked with shift-mouse click, then drag.
* middle circle is move plot
* Auto-layout tries to make room when things run off the page. This can be disabled.
* taller/shorter buttons on layout tab
* "same height" will make the selected plots the same height
* "fix layout" attempts to recover empty space and shift to avoid overlapping labels.

File->Reset Window clears everything and returns to the initial 1-plot state.
