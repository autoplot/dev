# Useful UNIX commands

Unix provides a bunch of command line programs which are useful
for modifying a file from a format which Autoplot can't use to one
that it can.  For example, the following script takes an events
file from PDS-PPI, and extracts a subset of the records and formats
them for Autoplot:

~~~~~
wget -O rawevents.dat https://pds-ppi.igpp.ucla.edu/data/JNO-E_J_SS-WAV-3-CDR-BSTFULL-V2.0/INDEX/INDEX.TAB
cat rawevents.dat | grep CRUISE | cut -c1-50 | uniq > events.dat
~~~~~

* <tt>wget</tt> downloads a URL into the file rawevents.dat
* <tt>cat</tt> loads lines from the file rawevents.dat and "pipes" (<tt>|</tt>) the lines into <tt>grep</tt>.
* this goes through <tt>grep</tt> to extract only the lines which contain "CRUISE"
* then goes through <tt>cut</tt> which pulls out the first 50 characters of each line
* then goes through <tt>uniq</tt> which culls repeated lines
* then directs (<tt>></tt>) the output to a new file, events.dat.

## Other useful commands
* <tt>gawk</tt> parses and formats ASCII files, record-by-record, with simple programs.
