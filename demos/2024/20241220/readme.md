A .jyds script reads the sunrise and sunset time files downloaded from https://aa.usno.navy.mil/.  This is a nice
example file because it is difficult to parse and also will make a nice example of a script with parameters
(lat, lon, and timezone) which can then be integrated into a HAPI server.

Snowflakes.jy is a script which paints snowflakes outside of the one plot showing, to make a holiday screenshot
for Autoplot release <a href='https://autoplot.org/jnlp/20241221a'>20241221a</a>.
