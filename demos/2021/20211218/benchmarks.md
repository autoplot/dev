The 2017 Desktop is a mid-fi desktop which cost around $1500 in parts. M1 laptop emulation is a 2021 Mac Book Pro, using the
emulation to run the Autoplot DMG release, which was made for Intel architecture.  BellSoft native
is a JVM I found which runs directly on the M1 hardware.  There were cosmetic flaws in the GUI, but
I was able to run the benchmark.  2021 Desktop is a mid-fi desktop to replace the 2017 one, which cost around $1500 in parts.
