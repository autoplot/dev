This creates three PngWalkTool windows, linked together.  The first shows the 
existing "correct" artifacts, the second shows the artifacts from the test, 
and the third shows differences.  A "copy" button accepts the test artifact
as the new correct artifact.

This must be run on Jeremy's computers.
