This script listDemoCdfFiles.jy lists all the CDF files in a web directory and
indicates the types of each variable.  The intent is to make sure that all
CDF variable types are represented here to make a thorough test suite.

This will write a markdown file in the local computer, so the script must be 
downloaded and run.  An example [output.md] has been committed to this dev area.
