This is looking to find a migration path from mediawiki to github.  The goal is to take 
mediawiki documents and convert them into markdown (or possibly .rst) and preserve them
on Github's Autoplot site.  Further, I'd like to find a platform for new documentation,
and this is where I'm looking at pandoc and readthedocs.org.
