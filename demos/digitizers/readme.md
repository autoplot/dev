Digitizers are applications created where human-guided mouse events are used to 
better interpret and derive new data.  Autoplot is based on the Das2 library, and
it was designed from the beginning to easily create interactive applications.

These are scripts that add useful functionality to graphics.  For example, addPointDigitizer
is run and then clicking on the plot will record the X and Y position of the click on a
new tab called "digitizer."  Points can be selected in the digitizer tab, and the selected
points are highlited on the plot, and can be deleted when mistakes are made.  These points 
can then be saved to a file.

Other digitizer scripts are described below.
